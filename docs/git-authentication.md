# Git Authentication Configuration

## Overview

The F2F DocView sync system requires Git authentication to pull updates from the GitHub repository. This guide explains how to configure authentication using GitHub Personal Access Tokens.

## Problem: Authentication Failed

If you're seeing "Git authentication failed" errors during sync operations, it's because:

1. No Git credentials are configured in the environment
2. Local Git configuration (user.name/email) is missing
3. Repository access permissions are insufficient

## Solution: Personal Access Token Authentication

### Step 1: Generate a Personal Access Token

1. Navigate to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click **"Generate new token (classic)"**
3. Configure the token:
   - **Note**: `F2F DocView Sync Token` (or similar descriptive name)
   - **Expiration**: Choose appropriate duration (90 days recommended for development)
   - **Scopes**: Select the following permissions:
     - âœ… `repo` - Full control of private repositories
     - âœ… `public_repo` - Access public repositories
4. Click **"Generate token"**
5. **Important**: Copy the token immediately - you won't be able to see it again

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Add the following to your `.env` file:

```env
# Git Authentication
NUXT_GIT_USERNAME=your-github-username
NUXT_GIT_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

Replace:
- `your-github-username` with your GitHub username
- `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` with your generated Personal Access Token

### Step 3: Verify Configuration

After setting up the credentials, test the sync functionality:

1. Navigate to your F2F DocView application
2. Log in with Discord authentication
3. Try the Git Pull operation (ðŸ”„ Git icon)
4. Check the browser console or server logs for success messages

## Authentication Flow

### With Credentials Configured
When `NUXT_GIT_USERNAME` and `NUXT_GIT_TOKEN` are provided:

```bash
# The system executes:
git pull https://username:token@github.com/Fail2Fail-Studios/una main
```

### Without Credentials (Fallback)
When credentials are not configured:

```bash
# Falls back to:
git pull origin main
# Relies on local Git configuration
```

## Security Best Practices

### Token Management
1. **Never commit tokens to version control** - they're in `.env` which is gitignored
2. **Use minimal required permissions** - only `repo` scope for this use case
3. **Set appropriate expiration** - balance security with convenience
4. **Rotate tokens regularly** - especially in production environments

### Environment Separation
Use different tokens for different environments:

```env
# Development
NUXT_GIT_TOKEN=ghp_dev_token_here

# Production  
NUXT_GIT_TOKEN=ghp_prod_token_here
```

### Access Control
- Create tokens under accounts with minimal required repository access
- For team use, consider using a dedicated service account
- Monitor token usage in GitHub's audit logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Authentication failed" after configuring token**
- Verify the token has correct permissions (`repo` scope)
- Check that the token hasn't expired
- Ensure username matches the token owner

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Verify repository access permissions
- Check if the repository is private and token has `repo` scope
- Confirm the repository URL matches your GitHub account access

**"Token not found" or similar**
- Ensure `.env` file is in the project root
- Verify environment variable names match exactly:
  - `NUXT_GIT_USERNAME` (not `GIT_USERNAME`)
  - `NUXT_GIT_TOKEN` (not `GIT_TOKEN`)
- Restart the development server after adding credentials

### Testing Authentication

To test if your credentials work outside the application:

```bash
# Test the authentication URL manually
git ls-remote https://your-username:your-token@github.com/Fail2Fail-Studios/una
```

If this command works, your credentials are valid.

## Alternative Authentication Methods

### SSH Keys (Not Recommended for this use case)
While SSH keys work for local development, they require additional configuration and don't work well in CI/CD environments.

### GitHub CLI (Development only)
For local development, you can use GitHub CLI authentication:

```bash
gh auth login
```

However, this won't work for the sync API endpoints and is only useful for manual Git operations.

## Production Considerations

### Environment Variables
In production, ensure sensitive environment variables are:
- Stored securely (not in plain text files)
- Rotated regularly
- Monitored for unauthorized access

### Fallback Strategies
The system includes fallback behavior when credentials aren't provided, but for reliable operations, authentication should always be configured.

### Monitoring
Monitor sync operations for authentication failures and set up alerts for repeated failures that might indicate token expiration or access issues.
